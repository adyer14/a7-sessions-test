This project shows ...

## Technical Achievements
- **Persistent IDs**: IDs are persistent through multiple sessions
- **Anonymous Logins**: Use of Google's anonymous authentication framework, retaining pseudo anonymity

### Design Achievements
- **CSS Grid Layout**: Use of CSS Grid formatting and style
- **Separation of Dashboard**: Editable content is along the right side of the page, while all read only content is on the left. This was designed with the user in mind. Studies have shown users read in a "F" pattern, meaning right side content is skimmed over and skipped. In this design, the right side is only necessary when a user is intentionally using those facets
